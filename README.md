# nginx-cases
Different scenarios with nginx on FreeBSD.

I wnat to share my experiences while switching from lighttpd to nginx and setting up 
* various web frameworks like moinmoin-wiki, egroupware, phpMyAdmin, mantis bugtracker, etc.
* static content like wpad.dat
* features like redirect/rewrite to the SSL part of the webserver, except some single urls.
